# Ecommerce App (MERN Stack)

This project is an ecommerce app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.

## Features

The ecommerce app includes the following features:

- User authentication and registration
- Product browsing and search functionality
- Product filtering and sorting options
- Add to cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Order history
- Payment integration
- Admin dashboard for managing products and orders

## Technologies Used

The app is built using the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing product data and user information.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the frontend.

## Folder Structure

The project follows a typical MERN folder structure:


- The `backend` folder contains the server-side code, including controllers, models, routes, and server setup.
- The `frontend` folder contains the client-side code, including components, pages, and services for making API requests.
- The `public` folder holds static assets used in the frontend.
- The `package.json` file manages project dependencies and scripts.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm install` to install the backend dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure environment variables (database connection, JWT secret, etc.).
4. Start the backend server by running `npm start`.
5. Open another terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.
6. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start`.
